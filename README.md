# movie-recommender
## Description: Developed a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering with Spark's Alternating Least Squares (ALS) implementation on the MovieLens dataset. This system leverages user-item interaction data to provide personalized movie recommendations.

## Technologies Used:

- Java Spark MLlib: Utilized Spark's machine learning library for implementing the ALS algorithm to perform collaborative filtering on the MovieLens dataset.
- Java Spark Streaming: Implemented real-time data processing using Spark Streaming to handle continuous data flow.
- Apache Kafka: Used Kafka for stream processing, ensuring reliable and scalable message handling between the data sources and the streaming application.
- Cassandra: Employed Cassandra as the storage solution for efficiently storing and retrieving user ratings and generated movie recommendations.
